## Description 
Our 3D Model Viewer Plugin is a game-changer for e-commerce sites. It allows customers to interact with product models in a highly immersive and engaging way. With our plugin, customers can explore 3D models on product pages, giving them a better understanding of the product's features and design.

The plugin also includes variant switching, making it easy for customers to compare different product options. This feature is particularly useful for products that come in different colors, sizes, or configurations. Plus, with mobile compatibility, customers can even view models in their own space using augmented reality (AR) technology.

By integrating our 3D Model Viewer Plugin with your variable product pages, you can take your online store to the next level. Provide your customers with a more engaging and interactive shopping experience, and watch your sales and customer satisfaction soar.

## Integrating with Variable Product Types
To integrate the 3D Model Viewer Plugin with variable product types, follow these steps:
1. Add 3D Model URL
When adding a new product, enter the 3D model URL in the designated field. This is where you'll host the 3D model image.
2. Select Variable Product Type. In the Product Data dropdown, select "Variable product."
3. Add Attribute. Click on "Attributes" and then "Add new." For the attribute name, enter "Variant." For the values, enter the names of each variant, separated by the "|" character (e.g., "Red|Blue|Green").
4. Generate Variations. Click on "Variations" and then "Generate variations." This will create a new variation for each attribute value you entered.
5. Set Variation Prices. Remember to set a price for each variation. This is a crucial step to ensure that your variable product is set up correctly.
By following these steps, you'll be able to integrate the 3D Model Viewer Plugin with variable product types, providing your customers with an immersive and engaging shopping experience.
